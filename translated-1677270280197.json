    "description": "When designing the Creator City residential complex, the developer adhered to the principle \"the real value is always inside\" - more light, greenery and space for walking, less unnecessary details. The project envisages the construction of eight buildings with a height of 16 and 24 floors, unique in their style, shape and architecture, but united by a common idea - a symbiosis of modern design, minimalism, functionality and technology. Panoramic glazing is planned in all sections, which guarantees the access of natural light to the rooms and improves the view from the apartments. The peculiarity of the Creator City residential complex is the concept of \"a city within a city\" - all the infrastructure necessary for life is located on the territory of the complex. For the safety of future residents, video surveillance cameras will be installed in public places, courtyards will be fenced off, and access to the entrance and elevator will only be possible with a pass card. There will be several play complexes for children of different ages, street simulators and a football field for athletes, and the highlight of the complex will be its own 2-hectare landscape park with a reservoir. So that cars do not interfere with a comfortable rest, the developer provided an underground two-level parking lot with an elevator. Infrastructure The residential complex of the Creator City business class is located in the historical part of Shevchenkivskyi district, between Degtyarivska and Zoologichna streets. The road to the city center takes 10 minutes by car, the Lukyanivska metro station and KPI can be reached on foot in 15-20 minutes. In addition to its own recreational green zone, the district has parks named after Pushkin, KPI, Kyrylivskyi Gai, Syretsky and \"Nyvky\". Children and adults will find it interesting to walk around the Kyiv Zoo, which is 2 km away. For the youngest, a private kindergarten will work on the territory of the complex, and within a 5-minute drive there are open gardens No. 130, No. 488 and MO Kids. It is convenient to bring schoolchildren to schools No. 61, No. 139 and No. 97 named after Carts are no more than 7 minutes away by car. There is a private gymnasium near the complex. The Creator City residential complex is perfect for students, as four leading universities are located within a 2.5 km radius: Kyiv National University of Economics, Kyiv Polytechnic, National Medical University named after Bogomolets and the Institute of International Relations at KNU. If you need to see a doctor, a private medical center will be opened within the complex. The Center for Children's Cardiology and Cardiac Surgery is a 10-minute walk away, and the Children's Hospital No. 8 and the Institute of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology are 15 minutes away. It takes about 7 minutes to get to the \"Okhmatdit\" clinic and the Kyiv Regional Hospital. Another feature of this project is the presence of its own sports complex with a swimming pool - you don't need to look for a place for training, everything you need is under the house. After exhausting classes, you can visit the spa center with a beauty salon right in the residential complex. If you still decide to visit another fitness club, there are AtletiCo, Sport&Spa and Sport Life within a radius of 2.5 km. You can buy groceries at the local supermarket near the first house. The nearest shops outside the complex, \"Fora\" and \"Silpo\", are located 8 and 15 minutes away on foot, respectively. You can arrange a day of shopping or take the children to the entertainment center in the Ukraina department store, the Promenada Center and Cosmopolite shopping centers - all are within a 7-minute drive from the house.

There are already traditional advantages for us, such as: rational planning, floor-to-ceiling stained glass windows, thoughtful architecture and interesting facades of buildings. The low-rise construction of the site, together with interesting landscaping, will give a feeling of comfortable stay in every corner of the complex. By the way, there will be only four apartments on each floor, which, you must agree, is also always very attractive for buyers. We hope that such a project solution will create all the conditions for warm neighborly relations. Welcome Home residential complex on Stetsenko deliberately did not create a large portfolio of planning solutions. There are only four of them. We have selected such layouts, which are in the greatest demand in our current projects and received a product that is ideally suited to both the location of the object and the target audience in this price segment of real estate. One-room apartments of 36-37 m2 and 48 m2. Two-room 55 m2. At the same time, each apartment has one room of 17 m2. The one-room apartments have a kitchen-living room of about 16 m2. The Fundament construction group in this project offers a product in which it is currently a leader among builders and developers of the capital's real estate market. This is a fast construction technology - up to one year from the start of construction work. So, we are talking about short-term investments and minimizing risks when buying at the initial stage of work, and, finally, we are talking about an available square meter. The Welcome Home apartment complex on Stetsenko is a project in which the concept of a residential complex is expressed not only in a logo or short-term advertising campaigns during the sale. We wanted to implement a project with such a highlight in landscaping and architecture that would delight the residents of the complex every day. The idea of ​​creating a residential art quarter appeared, where art objects would be created within the framework of a single theme and style. The theme was the animal world, namely - songbirds of Ukraine. The topic has huge potential - small architectural forms for children's playgrounds, murals on the facades of buildings, etc. Residents will soon be able to participate in this type of creativity. Firstly, the readiness of the first phase of Welcome Home on Stetsenko already in December 2016. And secondly, the selection of several art objects will take place through the voting of buyers.",

The peace of centuries-old oaks, cascades of clean lakes, the freshness of the water of a healing spring and several hectares of almost untouched nature. And all this is right next to your future home. On the other side is the National Complex \"Expocenter of Ukraine\" (formerly VDNH). In winter, you can come here to the \"Winter Country\", in summer - swim in the outdoor pool, in autumn and spring - ride bicycles or just walk along the cozy alleys. Holosiiv Forest and the National Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Ukraine (\"Pirogiv\") are spread around the residential complex From the complex, you can walk to the \"Teremka\" microdistrict, where all the necessary infrastructure facilities are concentrated - kindergartens, schools, lyceums, creative centers, beauty salons, bank branches, cafes and restaurants.

You can have a fun and useful time without going far from home - there are ArtMall and Magellan shopping centers on Zabolotny Street, and soon the largest shopping center of Ukraine \"Respublika\" will open.
